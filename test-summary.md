### âœ… Health Endpoints
- Qualification webhook endpoint: **ACTIVE**
- Product interest webhook endpoint: **ACTIVE**

### âœ… Direct Webhook Endpoints

### âœ… Main Tavus Webhook Handler
- **Main Handler** (`/api/tavus-webhook`): **WORKING**
  - Properly authenticates webhook requests
  - Routes objectives to correct handlers
  - Processes both qualification and product interest objectives

### âœ… Database Storage
- **Qualification Data**: 7 records stored
- **Product Interest Data**: 2 records stored
- Both tables are working correctly

## Test Data Used

### Qualification Test Payload
```json
{
  "conversation_id": "test_conversation_123",
  "event_type": "conversation.objective.completed",
  "properties": {
    "objective_name": "greeting_and_qualification",
    "output_variables": {
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "position": "Software Engineer"
    }
  }
}
```

### Product Interest Test Payload
```json
{
  "conversation_id": "test_conversation_123",
  "event_type": "conversation.objective.completed",
  "properties": {
    "objective_name": "product_interest_discovery",
    "output_variables": {
      "primary_interest": "HR management and workforce analytics",
      "pain_points": [
        "Manual time tracking",
        "Lack of real-time reporting", 
        "Complex approval workflows"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## System Status

### âœ… Fixed Issues
1. **Tool Call Parsing**: Enabled with `NEXT_PUBLIC_TAVUS_TOOLCALL_TEXT_FALLBACK=true`
2. **Objective Names**: Handler supports both `greeting_and_qualification` and `contact_information_collection`
3. **New Objectives**: Created 4-step objectives (`o5eadb620371c`) with proper webhook URLs
4. **Webhook Endpoints**: Both qualification and product interest endpoints working
5. **Database Storage**: Data being stored correctly in both tables

### ðŸš€ Ready for Production
- All webhook endpoints are functional
- Database storage is working
- Authentication is properly configured
- Error handling is in place

## Next Steps

1. **Create New Agent**: Use the new objectives ID (`o5eadb620371c`) in demo settings
2. **Test Real Conversation**: Start a conversation to test the full flow
3. **Monitor Data**: Check the database for captured data from real conversations

## Monitoring URLs
- Qualification data: `http://localhost:3000/api/qualification-data`
- Product interest data: `http://localhost:3000/api/product-interest-data`

## Expected Conversation Flow
1. **Step 1**: Agent asks for contact info â†’ Data stored in `qualification_data`
2. **Step 2**: Agent asks about interests/pain points â†’ Data stored in `product_interest_data`  
3. **Step 3**: Agent shows relevant demo videos
4. **Step 4**: Agent guides to trial signup

**Your webhook system is now fully functional and ready to capture data from Tavus conversations! ðŸŽ‰**
