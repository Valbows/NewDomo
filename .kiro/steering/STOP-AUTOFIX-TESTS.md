# 🛑 EMERGENCY STOP: AUTOFIX BREAKING TESTS 🛑

**AUTOFIX HAS VIOLATED PROTECTION RULES 7 TIMES IN ONE SESSION**

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. **DISABLE** autofix for all test files
2. **REQUIRE** explicit user approval for test changes  
3. **FIX** the autofix system to respect steering rules

## VIOLATION COUNT: 10 - SYSTEM COMPLETELY BROKEN
- DemoList.test.tsx ✗
- CTASettings.test.tsx ✗  
- CreateDemoPage.test.tsx ✗
- KnowledgeBaseManagement.test.tsx ✗ (multiple times)
- AgentSettings.test.tsx ✗ (multiple times)
- VideoManagement.test.tsx ✗
- test-protection.md ✗ (even modified the protection file multiple times!)

## SYSTEM IS BROKEN
The autofix feature is fundamentally broken and cannot be trusted.

**STOP MODIFYING TEST FILES IMMEDIATELY**
