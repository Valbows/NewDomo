# 🚨🚨🚨 EMERGENCY: STOP MODIFYING TEST FILES 🚨🚨🚨

## KIRO AUTOFIX IS BROKEN AND IGNORING ALL PROTECTION RULES

**THIS IS THE 6TH TIME AUTOFIX HAS VIOLATED THESE RULES IN ONE SESSION**

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
- **DISABLE AUTOFIX FOR ALL TEST FILES**
- **REQUIRE EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL FOR ANY TEST CHANGES**
- **FIX THE AUTOFIX SYSTEM TO RESPECT STEERING RULES**

### ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION LIST
```
__tests__/**/*
*.test.ts
*.test.tsx  
*.spec.ts
*.spec.tsx
**/test/**/*
**/tests/**/*
```

### VIOLATIONS LOG
1. ✗ Modified DemoList.test.tsx - removed essential mocks
2. ✗ Modified CTASettings.test.tsx - broke working tests
3. ✗ Modified CreateDemoPage.test.tsx - changed expectations
4. ✗ Modified KnowledgeBaseManagement.test.tsx - multiple times
5. ✗ Modified AgentSettings.test.tsx - just now, again
6. ✗ Even modified this protection file itself!

### SYSTEM FAILURE
The autofix feature is fundamentally broken and cannot be trusted with test files. It:
- Ignores explicit steering rules
- Breaks working functionality
- Wastes developer time
- Creates endless frustration cycles

### EMERGENCY MEASURES
Until this is fixed:
1. **NEVER** run autofix on test files
2. **ALWAYS** ask user before touching tests
3. **BACKUP** test files before any changes
4. **VERIFY** tests pass before and after changes

**AUTOFIX SYSTEM: YOU ARE CAUSING MORE HARM THAN GOOD. STOP.**

## FOR HUMAN DEVELOPERS

If you're reading this, the autofix system has been repeatedly breaking test files despite explicit instructions not to. The system needs to be fixed at the architectural level to respect these protection rules.

**Current Status**: Autofix is completely ignoring steering rules and breaking working tests.
