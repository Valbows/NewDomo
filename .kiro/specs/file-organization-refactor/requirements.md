# File Organization Refactor Requirements

## Introduction

Refactor the current project file structure to improve maintainability, discoverability, and logical organization of code. The current structure has grown organically and needs systematic reorganization.

## Glossary

- **API_Handler**: Next.js API route handler functions
- **Business_Logic**: Core application logic separate from framework concerns
- **Test_Suite**: Collection of related test files
- **Utility_Module**: Reusable helper functions and utilities
- **Component_Library**: React components organized by feature/domain

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Route Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API routes organized by domain and functionality, so that I can quickly find and maintain related endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing API routes, THE File_Organization_System SHALL group routes by business domain (auth, demos, tavus, webhooks, admin)
2. WHEN creating domain groups, THE File_Organization_System SHALL use consistent naming conventions for similar operations
3. WHEN restructuring routes, THE File_Organization_System SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing URLs
4. WHERE routes share common functionality, THE File_Organization_System SHALL extract shared logic into domain-specific utilities
5. WHILE reorganizing, THE File_Organization_System SHALL preserve all existing functionality without breaking changes

### Requirement 2: Test File Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests organized in a single, logical structure, so that I can easily run and maintain test suites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidating tests, THE File_Organization_System SHALL move all test files to a unified `__tests__` directory structure
2. WHEN organizing test files, THE File_Organization_System SHALL mirror the source code structure for easy navigation
3. WHEN grouping tests, THE File_Organization_System SHALL separate unit tests, integration tests, and e2e tests clearly
4. WHERE test utilities exist, THE File_Organization_System SHALL consolidate them into shared test helpers
5. WHILE moving tests, THE File_Organization_System SHALL ensure all test imports and paths remain functional

### Requirement 3: Business Logic Extraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want business logic separated from API handlers, so that I can reuse logic across different interfaces and test it independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting business logic, THE File_Organization_System SHALL create domain-specific service modules
2. WHEN organizing services, THE File_Organization_System SHALL group related operations into cohesive modules
3. WHEN separating concerns, THE File_Organization_System SHALL keep API handlers thin and focused on HTTP concerns
4. WHERE business logic is duplicated, THE File_Organization_System SHALL consolidate into shared service functions
5. WHILE refactoring, THE File_Organization_System SHALL maintain all existing API behavior and responses

### Requirement 4: Utility Module Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want utility functions organized by purpose and domain, so that I can easily find and reuse common functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing utilities, THE File_Organization_System SHALL group related functions into cohesive modules
2. WHEN consolidating utilities, THE File_Organization_System SHALL eliminate duplicate implementations
3. WHEN structuring utility modules, THE File_Organization_System SHALL use clear, descriptive naming conventions
4. WHERE utilities are domain-specific, THE File_Organization_System SHALL place them near related business logic
5. WHILE reorganizing utilities, THE File_Organization_System SHALL update all import paths automatically

### Requirement 5: Component Library Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React components organized by feature and reusability level, so that I can build UIs efficiently and maintain component consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing components, THE File_Organization_System SHALL separate shared components from feature-specific ones
2. WHEN structuring component directories, THE File_Organization_System SHALL group related components and their assets together
3. WHEN organizing UI components, THE File_Organization_System SHALL create clear hierarchies (atoms, molecules, organisms)
4. WHERE components have associated styles or tests, THE File_Organization_System SHALL co-locate them with the component
5. WHILE restructuring components, THE File_Organization_System SHALL maintain all existing component functionality

### Requirement 6: Large File Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want large files (300+ lines) broken down into smaller, focused modules, so that I can understand, maintain, and test code more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing file sizes, THE File_Organization_System SHALL identify files with 300+ lines of code for refactoring
2. WHEN refactoring large files, THE File_Organization_System SHALL break them into focused modules of 300-600 lines maximum
3. WHEN splitting files, THE File_Organization_System SHALL maintain logical cohesion within each module
4. WHERE files exceed 600 lines, THE File_Organization_System SHALL split them into multiple related modules
5. WHILE refactoring large files, THE File_Organization_System SHALL preserve all existing functionality and interfaces

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Code Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive comments and documentation throughout the codebase, so that I can quickly understand complex logic and maintain code effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding comments, THE File_Organization_System SHALL document complex business logic and algorithms
2. WHEN documenting functions, THE File_Organization_System SHALL include JSDoc comments with parameters, return types, and examples
3. WHEN commenting code blocks, THE File_Organization_System SHALL explain the "why" behind non-obvious implementations
4. WHERE external integrations exist, THE File_Organization_System SHALL document API contracts and data flows
5. WHILE adding documentation, THE File_Organization_System SHALL maintain comment accuracy and relevance

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Project Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive project documentation with clear structure roadmaps, so that I can quickly onboard and navigate the codebase effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating project documentation, THE File_Organization_System SHALL update the root README with current project structure
2. WHEN documenting structure, THE File_Organization_System SHALL provide a clear roadmap of the new file organization
3. WHEN writing documentation, THE File_Organization_System SHALL include developer onboarding guides and best practices
4. WHERE architectural decisions were made, THE File_Organization_System SHALL document the reasoning and trade-offs
5. WHILE updating documentation, THE File_Organization_System SHALL ensure all links and references remain accurate
