## What Was NOT Changed
- ✅ Backend API endpoints and logic (still use Tavus API)
- ✅ Component names (still `TavusConversationCVI`, etc.)
- ✅ Database field names (still `tavus_persona_id`, etc.)
- ✅ Environment variables (still `TAVUS_API_KEY`, etc.)
- ✅ Import statements and internal references
- ✅ Variable names and function names
- ✅ Console logs and debug messages (backend)

## Result
- **User Experience**: All visible text now shows "Domo" branding
- **Functionality**: 100% preserved - all features work exactly the same
- **Backend**: No changes to API integration or data handling
- **Development**: No impact on component structure or imports

## Testing
