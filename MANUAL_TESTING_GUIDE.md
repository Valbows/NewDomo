# üß™ Manual Testing Guide - Tavus Objectives System

This guide walks you through manually testing the objectives system with real Tavus conversations.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Set Up Objectives
```bash
# Create objectives in Tavus
TAVUS_API_KEY=44bc5f162b174fe5b3ce8d92b4565551 npx tsx scripts/setup-objectives.ts
```

This will output objectives IDs like:
```
Demo Objectives ID: o123456789
Qualification Objectives ID: o987654321
```

### Step 2: Create Test Personas
```bash
# Create personas with objectives
TAVUS_API_KEY=44bc5f162b174fe5b3ce8d92b4565551 npx tsx examples/create-persona-with-objectives.ts
```

This will create personas with structured conversation flows.

## üîç What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Successful Objective Completion
- Agent follows the exact sequence defined in objectives
- Agent collects all specified output variables
- Conditional branching works based on user responses
- Manual confirmation steps pause for user input

### ‚úÖ Data Collection
- Each objective captures the defined variables
- Variables are used in subsequent objectives
- Agent remembers context from previous objectives

### ‚úÖ Flow Control
- Agent doesn't skip objectives inappropriately
- Conditional logic works correctly
- No circular loops or infinite branching

### ‚ùå Common Issues to Watch For
- Agent skips objectives or goes out of order
- Agent doesn't collect required variables
- Conditional branching doesn't work
- Agent gets stuck in loops
- Manual confirmation steps don't pause properly

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Tips

### Check Objective Completion
Monitor the conversation for objective completion events. You should see:
- Clear progression through each objective
- Collection of specified variables
- Appropriate branching based on conditions

### Verify Variable Collection
The agent should reference collected information:
```
"Based on what you told me about your company size (50 people)..."
"Since you mentioned your budget is $10k..."
"Given your interest in analytics tools..."
```

### Test Edge Cases
- What happens if user gives unexpected responses?
- Does agent handle objections gracefully?
- Can user interrupt the flow and resume?
- Does agent recover from errors?

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Following Objectives
1. Check that objectives_id was properly attached to persona
2. Verify objectives were created successfully in Tavus
3. Ensure no circular dependencies in objective flow

### Missing Variable Collection
1. Check objective definitions include output_variables
2. Verify agent is asking the right questions
3. Ensure variables are being used in subsequent objectives

### Branching Not Working
1. Verify conditional objectives exist in the template
2. Check condition descriptions are clear
3. Ensure referenced objectives are defined

### Manual Confirmation Issues
1. Check confirmation_mode is set to "manual"
2. Verify agent pauses for user confirmation
3. Ensure user can proceed after confirmation

## üìû Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the logs** - Look for objective completion events
2. **Verify the setup** - Run the test suite to ensure everything is working
3. **Test with simple objectives** - Start with basic flows before complex ones
4. **Review the templates** - Ensure objective definitions are correct

## üéØ Next Steps

Once manual testing is successful:

1. **Create custom objectives** for your specific business needs
2. **Monitor objective completion rates** to optimize flows  
3. **A/B test different conversation flows** to improve outcomes
4. **Integrate with your CRM** to capture collected variables
5. **Set up webhooks** to trigger actions on objective completion
