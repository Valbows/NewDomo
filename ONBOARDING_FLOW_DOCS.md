# Onboarding Flow Implementation

## Overview
A modern 4-step onboarding experience for Domo AI demo configuration, inspired by Slack's onboarding and Fitocracy's step-by-step flow. This provides a guided, user-friendly alternative to the traditional tabbed configuration interface.

## Features Implemented

### ðŸŽ¯ 4-Step Configuration Flow
1. **Video Upload** - Add demo video content with drag-and-drop interface
2. **Knowledge Base** - Configure AI knowledge with Q&A pairs and document uploads
3. **Call-to-Action** - Set up conversion goals with live preview
4. **Agent Settings** - Configure AI agent personality, greeting, and objectives

### âœ¨ UX/UI Enhancements
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual step progression with checkmarks for completed steps
- **Welcome Modal**: Onboarding introduction with process overview and time estimate
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion transitions between steps
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with modern gradients
- **Interactive Elements**: Clickable step navigation and hover effects
- **Completion Status**: Real-time tracking of step completion with visual feedback

### ðŸŽ¨ Design System
- **Color-coded Steps**: Each step has a unique color theme (blue, green, orange, purple)
- **Icon System**: Lucide icons for consistent visual language
- **Card-based Layout**: Clean, modern card design for each step
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Subtle gradients for visual appeal
