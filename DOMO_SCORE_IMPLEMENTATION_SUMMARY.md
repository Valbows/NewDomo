# Domo Score Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've implemented a comprehensive "Domo Score" credibility scoring system that evaluates the quality and completeness of data captured during demo conversations. The score ranges from 0-5 points, with each point representing a key milestone in the customer qualification process.

## Scoring Criteria (5 Points Total)

### 1. Contact Confirmation = 1 Point
- **Criteria**: User provided email, first name, or last name
- **Data Source**: `qualification_data` table
- **Badge**: ‚úÖ Contact Confirmation

### 2. Reason Why They Visited Site = 1 Point  
- **Criteria**: User shared primary interest or pain points
- **Data Source**: `product_interest_data` table
- **Badge**: ‚úÖ Reason Why They Visited Site

### 3. Platform Feature Most Interested In = 1 Point
- **Criteria**: User requested specific videos or videos were shown
- **Data Source**: `video_showcase_data` table  
- **Badge**: ‚úÖ Platform Feature Most Interested In

### 4. CTA Execution = 1 Point
- **Criteria**: User clicked the trial CTA button (not just shown)
- **Data Source**: `cta_tracking` table
- **Badge**: ‚úÖ CTA Execution

### 5. Perception Analysis = 1 Point
- **Criteria**: Valid perception analysis exists (user had video on, not black screen)
- **Data Source**: `conversation_details.perception_analysis`
- **Badge**: ‚úÖ Perception Analysis

## Score Interpretation

### Score Ranges:
- **5/5 (100%)** - Excellent: Complete qualification, high credibility
- **4/5 (80%)** - Good: Strong qualification, good credibility  
- **3/5 (60%)** - Fair: Moderate qualification, fair credibility
- **2/5 (40%)** - Poor: Minimal qualification, low credibility
- **1/5 (20%)** - Very Poor: Almost no qualification
- **0/5 (0%)** - No Data: No meaningful interaction captured

### Color Coding:
- **Green**: 4-5 points (Excellent/Good)
- **Blue**: 3 points (Fair) 
- **Yellow**: 2 points (Poor)
- **Red**: 0-1 points (Very Poor/No Data)

## UI Implementation

### 1. Summary Dashboard
- **Location**: Top metrics cards (5th card)
- **Display**: Average Domo Score across all conversations
- **Format**: "X.X/5" with percentage credibility
- **Color**: Purple theme with trophy icon üèÜ

### 2. Conversation List Badges
- **Location**: Next to other data badges in conversation list
- **Display**: Individual score for each conversation
- **Format**: "üèÜ X/5" 
- **Color**: Dynamic based on score (green/blue/yellow/red)

### 3. Detailed Score Card (Right Sidebar)
- **Location**: Right column when conversation is expanded
- **Features**:
  - Large score display with label (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor)
  - Detailed breakdown of each scoring criterion
  - Individual point awards (‚úÖ/‚ùå for each category)
  - Progress bar showing credibility percentage
  - Sticky positioning for easy reference

## Technical Implementation

### Scoring Function
```typescript
function calculateDomoScore(
  contact: ContactInfo | null,
  productInterest: ProductInterestData | null,
  videoShowcase: VideoShowcaseData | null,
  ctaTracking: CtaTrackingData | null,
  perceptionAnalysis: any
): { score: number; maxScore: number; breakdown: { [key: string]: boolean } }
```

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Calculation**: Scores update automatically when new data arrives
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Shows exactly which criteria were met
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded progress bars and badges
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Performance Optimized**: Calculations cached per conversation

## Business Value

### For Sales Teams:
- **Lead Qualification**: Quickly identify high-quality prospects
- **Follow-up Prioritization**: Focus on conversations with higher scores
- **Conversion Prediction**: Higher scores correlate with better conversion rates

### For Marketing Teams:
- **Demo Effectiveness**: Track which demos generate better engagement
- **Content Optimization**: Identify which features drive more interest
- **Campaign ROI**: Measure quality of leads from different sources

### For Product Teams:
- **User Behavior Insights**: Understand what drives user engagement
- **Feature Interest**: See which platform features generate most interest
- **UX Optimization**: Identify friction points in the qualification process

## Analytics Capabilities

### Aggregate Metrics:
- Average Domo Score across all conversations
- Score distribution (how many 5/5, 4/5, etc.)
- Trend analysis over time
- Correlation with actual conversions

### Segmentation:
- Score by traffic source
- Score by demo type/configuration  
- Score by time of day/week
- Score by user demographics

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
- **Weighted Scoring**: Different point values for different criteria
- **Time-based Scoring**: Bonus points for faster qualification
- **Engagement Scoring**: Points for longer conversations
- **Quality Scoring**: Points for detailed responses
- **Behavioral Scoring**: Points for specific user actions

### Advanced Analytics:
- **Predictive Scoring**: ML model to predict conversion likelihood
- **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmark against industry standards
- **A/B Testing**: Compare scores across different demo variations
- **ROI Correlation**: Link scores to actual revenue outcomes

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation:
- `src/app/demos/[demoId]/configure/components/Reporting.tsx` - Main scoring logic and UI
- Added `calculateDomoScore()` function
- Added `DomoScoreCard` component  
- Updated summary metrics to include average score
- Added score badges to conversation list
- Implemented right-sidebar detailed score display

### Dependencies:
